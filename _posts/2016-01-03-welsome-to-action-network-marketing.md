Welcome to Action Network Marketing. This site is dedicated to providing simple, daily actions for network marketers to begin, grow, and succeed in your network marketing business goals.

I started Action Network Marketing as a simple method to establish myself as a professional network marketer. I had been involved in a couple different companies, but with very little success. I had studied the basics,  as well as the finer points on network marketing from all the big names in the industry, but was overwhelmed with how to organize and implement all this good direction into simple, daily actions. It was obvious that I lacked the discipline to implement the lessons I was learning into everyday actions that would grow my business effectively.

If you are new to network marketing and looking for a place to start, I highly recommend that you take direction from your company and upline. This is important to get some momentum working to your advantage. You can learn the finer points as you are better accustomed to how network marketing works in your company. But, as mentioned, it is always best to look to your upline. They know what duplicates.

I will be sharing my experience here, on Action Network Marketing. It may be overly simple and rudimentary for some. But my first goal is to lay a solid foundation for myself, in my own business. If it helps you, great. If not, well then, you should probably be out prospecting or writing your own blog post.  I teach what I learn so that it becomes ingrained in me what I need to do and be, so that I can have. I want to be, do, and have a lot. Network Marketing can offer a lot for the people willing to work for it. My wish is to be able to help others in many different ways. Action Network Marketing will be one of the tools I will use to share with you and give back.
